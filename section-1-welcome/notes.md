# Section 1: Welcome, Welcome, Welcome

## Course Roadmap and Projects
- The course is organized in 4 parts
  - Fundamentals
    - Components
  - Intermediate
    - Fetching Data
  - Advanced
    - Performance Optimization
    - Redux
  - Professional Dev
    - Will put all of our knowledge together with two big apps
- There are tons

## Building Our First React App!
- You can create a new app through chome by typing in react.new
- Code sandbox is built off of VSCode 
- You'll see that a component is really just a function 
- State is the most fundamental concept of react 
  - Whenever we need something to change, we use state 
- useEffect - takes two arguments the function and then the dependence array (we will learn about this later)
- In React we try to divide UI's into components 

## Watch Before You Start!
- Some quick considerations before we start 
  - This course is for everyone, so please don't write a bad review right away if the course is too easy, or too hard, or progressing too slow, or too fast for you 
  - To make the course perfect for YOU: rewatch lectures, jump to other sections, watch the course with slower or faster speed, or ask questions 
  - You don't need to watch the entire course in order to learn React! If you are in a hurry, can cut the course length in half 
  - You need to code along, you will learn zero React skills by just sitting and watching code. You really have to write code yourself 
  - In the first sections of the course, don't worr about WHY and HOW things work, or about React "best practices". While learning, we just want to make things WORK. We will worry about everything else later in the course 
  - If you have some problem or a question, start by trying to solve it yourself. This is essential for your progress, you can't solve it, check the Q&A section 
  - Before moving on from a section, make sure that you understand exactly what was covered. Take a break, review the code we wrote, review your notes, review the projects we built, and maybe even write some code yourself
